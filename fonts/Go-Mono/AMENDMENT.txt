The directory mini/ contains versions of the fonts in [woff] format with some
glyphs removed. The following Unicode ranges are removed from the fonts in the
mini/ directory.

- Latin Extended-A
- Latin Extended-B
- Space Modifier Letters

Essentially what remains is a Latin-1 font with some math, currency and extra
punctuation symbols.
