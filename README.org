#+title: Emacs Org mode CSS for HTML export
#+options: toc:nil num:nil author:nil timestamp:nil ^:nil
#+setupfile: inline.css.org

A CSS file for [[https://orgmode.org/][Emacs Org mode]] HTML export that provides an easy to read style
suitable for smaller documents.

I've come to use Org mode for much of my work related planning and tracking
progress on tasks. Sometimes I'm requested to provide a report by email at which
time it's convenient to be able to export what's readily available in one of my
Org files. I also write longer emails in Org mode as I think it's easier to
create a decent structure.

See https://johan-bolmsjo.github.io/org_css/README.html for how this document is
rendered as HTML.

* CSS Usage

Use a block such as the following to specify document options and to inline the
CSS file into the exported HTML file.

#+begin_src org
  ,#+options: toc:nil num:nil author:nil timestamp:nil ^:nil
  ,#+setupfile: inline.css.org
#+end_src

I usually place the block after the Org document title. Export to HTML with the
command =M-x org-html-export-to-html=.

** Custom Font

A custom serif font is used for body text as I think the default serif font
used by web browsers is too dense. If you come to rely on this CSS file you are
wise to provide your own font source. See [[file:org.css][org.css]] for details. The custom
font can be found in [[file:fonts/Lora][fonts/Lora]].

** Disabling HTML Validation Link

Org mode exports a HTML validation link by default. There does not seem to be a
way to disable the link by using =#+options:= in the Org file. Add the following
to the Emacs init file to disable the generated HTML validation link.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; HTML output: Don't emit validation link
  (setq org-html-validation-link nil)
#+end_src

* CSS Modifications

Edit the file [[file:org.css][org.css]] and update the file =inline.css.org= by running
=make=. The [[https://yui.github.io/yuicompressor/][YUI Compressor]] program is used to compress the CSS to reduce the
size of exported HTML files.

Example (Debian based Linux):
#+begin_src
  sudo apt-get install yui-compressor
  make
#+end_src
